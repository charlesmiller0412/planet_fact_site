## My process

### Built with

-   CSS custom properties
-   Flexbox
-   [TypeScript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/)
-   [React](https://reactjs.org/) - JS library
-   [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) - React framework
-   SASS (SCSS)
-   BEM Block Element Modifier

### What I learned

**Next.JS** - it is quite a challenge to use breakpoints with the Images component. I also ran in to the issue that Next.JS is a server side framework, therefore `window` has to be used dynamically or the build will fail since it is client side and post render.

### **Useful resources**

_Keep in mind that I only use documentation for my projects as this is the best way to understand the tool being used._
